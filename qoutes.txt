Hello There!
Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin, they betray you.
So uncivilized.
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
I have the high ground.
Use the Force, Luke.
You are a bold one!
You were my brother, Anakin! I loved you!
You want to go home and rethink your life.
Remember, the Force will be with you. Always.
Good God Anakin.
